                        <p>Throughout our years in business, we've accumulated a strong expertise both in managing and
                            completing any type of a construction, as well as in choosing the right vendors and
                            sub-contractors... We understand how vital it is to coordinate the project in a timely,
                            cost-efficient way. As of now we've alreeady dealt with numerous mid and large scale
                            constructions, so we've mastered the art of minimizing the extra expenses, completing each
                            project's stage on schedule and implementing a live project intact with both original
                            engineering solutions and the client's initial vision...</p><a class="button button-primary"

                            iterations efficient life cycles for that.</p>
                        <p>As you may know, the construction planning process has always been far from perfect... In the
                            past, project schedules were unrealistically optimistic... That resulted in an average of 45% of
                            work promised in a week actually being completed at a later date than its deadline dictated.
                            This kind of protraction left subcontractors waiting for the previous task to be completed, even
                            before the next stage of work could have proceeded further... To fix that issue, our
                            construction bureau have implemented the Pull Planning process, coordinated with the trade
                            contractors on a weekly basis. Pull Planning method estimates the scheduling in reverse.</p><a
